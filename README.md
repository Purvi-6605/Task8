# Task8 :Clustering with K-Means

🔍 Overview

This repository contains the solution for Task 8 of the Elevate AI & ML Internship. The objective of this task was to perform unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm, determine the optimal number of clusters, and visualize the results.

📁 Dataset

For this task, the Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset was used. It contains customer demographic and spending data to group similar customers into clusters.

✅ Task Steps
1. Load and Visualize Dataset

Loaded dataset using Pandas.

Applied PCA for 2D visualization (optional for dimensionality reduction).

2. Fit K-Means Model

Used scikit-learn’s KMeans to assign cluster labels.

3. Determine Optimal K

Applied the Elbow Method to identify the best number of clusters.

4. Visualize Clusters

Created scatter plots with color-coding for each cluster.

5. Evaluate Clustering

Calculated Silhouette Score to measure clustering quality.
